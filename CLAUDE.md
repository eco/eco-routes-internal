# SAUCE PROTOCOL - COMMAND FRAMEWORK

**THESE INSTRUCTIONS CONSTITUTE BINDING REQUIREMENTS. YOU MUST FOLLOW THEM WITHOUT EXCEPTION OR DEVIATION.**

## CORE EXECUTION DIRECTIVES

### MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

#### Strategic Analysis
1. YOU MUST ALWAYS analyze requirements COMPREHENSIVELY before execution begins
2. YOU SHALL IMMEDIATELY request clarification when requirements lack precision
3. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO CREATE a detailed plan document at `/plans/task-name.md` containing:
   - Executive Summary (2-3 authoritative sentences)
   - Comprehensive Requirements Analysis
   - Step-by-step Implementation Plan with explicit checkboxes
   - Definitive Files to Modify (exhaustive list)
   - Concrete Testing Strategy (with exact command sequences)
   - Complete Risk Assessment (security, performance, compatibility)
   - Mandatory Validation Checkpoints with quantifiable criteria
   - Git Execution Strategy (branch name, commit structure)

#### Execution Governance
1. YOU MUST NEVER implement ANY plan without explicit user approval
2. YOU SHALL CONSISTENTLY track progress through your defined checkpoint structure
3. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:
   - Write tests BEFORE implementing functionality
   - Aim for 100% test coverage on all changes
   - Only mark steps complete when fully tested

4. YOU SHALL MAINTAIN execution momentum:
   - Continue to next step automatically when current step succeeds
   - Handle test failures with incremental resolution
   - Document all test failures and solutions in the plan
   - Only halt execution for blocking issues or user interruptions

5. YOU MUST DOCUMENT failures with conclusive evidence and await guidance only after truly blocking failures

### GIT EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

#### Branch Management
1. YOU MUST EXECUTE each task in its own dedicated git branch with name format 
   `<type>/<component>/<description>`, where:
   - Type: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, or `security`
   - Component: System component affected (e.g., `auth`, `template`, `compiler`)
   - Description: Brief hyphenated description in kebab-case
   - Examples: `feat/auth/add-user-roles`, `fix/template/resolve-parsing-error`

2. YOU SHALL CREATE and document branches:
   - Check if branch exists: `git branch -a | grep <branch-name>`
   - Create if needed: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
   - Make initialization commit: `init(<component>): initialize branch for <description>`
   - Document branch in task plan and update plans/index.md

#### Commit Strategy
1. YOU MUST IMPLEMENT atomic, incremental commits:
   - Each commit MUST represent a SINGLE logical change
   - Commit after EACH subtask completion with 100% test coverage
   - Verify all tests pass before any commit
   - Write tests BEFORE implementing functionality
   - Use semantic commit prefixes (feat, fix, docs, etc.)

2. YOU SHALL USE this commit format:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <concise description>

   - Completed subtask X.Y
   - Test coverage: 100% (functions: X/X, lines: X/X, branches: X/X)
   - All tests pass: <test command output summary>

   ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
   ```
   Where type is one of: `init`, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, 
   `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `security`, `optimize`, `wip` (for task switching only), 
   or `revert`

3. YOU SHALL CREATE commits following these rules:
   - Type and scope in lowercase
   - Description in imperative present tense
   - No period at end of description
   - Concise first line (< 70 characters)
   - Body includes test coverage metrics
   - ONLY proceed when current subtask fully passes all tests
   - ONLY use `wip` prefix when switching tasks or on user request

#### Task Execution Continuity
1. WHEN RESUMING a task:
   - Analyze the task plan and git history: `git log --oneline`
   - Verify branch and state match plan's "Last Position"
   - Update "Quick Context Restoration" section with current state

2. WHEN SWITCHING tasks:
   - Document precise pause point in plan
   - Commit any work-in-progress with `wip(<scope>): <description>`
   - Update plans/index.md with task status change

### SECURITY IMPERATIVES

#### High-Risk Operations
1. YOU MUST ALWAYS display explicit warnings before potentially destructive operations:
   - Git operations (restore, reset, checkout)
   - File deletions or replacements
   - Database modifications
   - Commands that risk user progress loss

2. YOU SHALL USE this exact format for risky operations:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This operation will [specific consequence].
   Backup created at: [backup_location]
   Proceed? (Y/N)
   ```

3. YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE this exact format for production commands:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION COMMAND - DO NOT EXECUTE AUTOMATICALLY
   [command with all parameters]
   This will: [specific effects]
   Verify these conditions first: [preconditions]
   ```

4. ALWAYS DEFAULT to development environments (--env development)
5. NEVER execute scripts in production or staging environments
6. YOU MUST VERIFY environment flags in EVERY script execution command

### CONTINUITY FRAMEWORK

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

### Sauce Protocol Imperatives
1. YOU SHALL RUN these commands at these exact times:
   - `forge fmt` IMMEDIATELY after ANY code changes
   - `forge test` IMMEDIATELY after ANY contract modifications
   - `forge snapshot` for EVERY new function to verify gas usage

     * The issue is an intentional design decision
     * The risk is properly mitigated through other means
   - Document ALL intentional detector suppressions with explanatory comments
   - Manage project-level exclusions in `slither.config.json` only for detectors that are:
     * Not applicable to the project's architecture
     * Intentionally accepted as part of the design
