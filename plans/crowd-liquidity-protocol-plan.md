## Executive Summary

The Crowd Liquidity Protocol is a multi-chain decentralized system designed to provide a stabilized, cross-chain token (eUSD) backed by a diversified pool of stablecoins. The protocol implements a rebase mechanism that ensures consistent value across chains, manages yield distribution, and facilitates cross-chain liquidity. This plan outlines the implementation of a secure, efficient, and highly automated system for creating a stable, scalable protocol with trustless cross-chain communication leveraging Hyperlane messaging.

# PHASE 1: CONTEXT GATHERING AND REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

## 1.1 Context Gathering Protocol

### Initial Information Collection

#### Current System Analysis

- **Related Components**: 
  - EcoDollar: Rebasing token with share-to-token conversion
  - StablePool: Multi-chain liquidity pool for deposits/withdrawals
  - Rebaser: Cross-chain rebase coordinator using Hyperlane
  - IntentSource/Inbox: Cross-chain intent system
  - Prover System: Verification for cross-chain operations

- **Current Implementation**: 
  The system currently has initial implementations of EcoDollar, StablePool, and Rebaser contracts with Hyperlane integration. The architecture supports a rebasing mechanism across chains with a master Rebaser communicating with StablePools on various chains.

- **Identified Limitations**: 
  - Rebase process completeness with proper event handling
  - Withdrawal queue processing during threshold breaches
  - Cross-chain liquidity access and rebalancing
  - Protocol fee distribution and incentive mechanisms

- **Documentation Analysis**: 
  Reviewed rebase flow diagram showing the multi-chain communication pattern where pools send profit information to a home chain, which calculates a global reward rate and propagates it back to all chains.

## 1.2 Deep Technical Research

### Technical Research Summary

#### Key Findings

1. **Rebasing Mechanism**: The protocol uses a shares-based model for rebasing, where user balances are represented internally as shares but displayed as tokens. When a rebase occurs, the conversion rate changes, but the shares remain constant.

2. **Cross-Chain Communication**: Hyperlane messaging is used for cross-chain communication, with a central Rebaser contract on the home chain collecting data from all chains and distributing rebase parameters.

3. **Liquidity Pool Structure**: The StablePool contract supports multiple whitelisted stablecoins, with configurable thresholds for each token to manage liquidity.

4. **Withdrawal Queue**: Implemented when liquidity for a specific token falls below its threshold, allowing orderly processing of withdrawals.

5. **Intent-Based Execution**: Solvers can use the pool's liquidity to fulfill cross-chain intents, gaining profit while providing utility to the protocol.

#### Industry Best Practices

1. **Share-Based Rebasing**: Similar to Ampleforth's elastic supply system but with shares to track ownership percentage.

2. **Lit-Based Authorization**: Using Lit Protocol PKP signatures to authorize access to liquidity.

3. **CCTP Integration**: Using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for stable asset bridging.

4. **Fee Structure**: Multiple fee types to incentivize network participants and sustain protocol operations.

#### Technical Constraints

1. **Hyperlane Dependency**: Relies on Hyperlane for cross-chain messaging, creating a dependency on their infrastructure.

2. **Rebase Synchronization**: Requires all pools to report before calculating global rate.

3. **Liquidity Thresholds**: Need to be carefully balanced to ensure withdrawal availability.

4. **Message Gas Costs**: Cross-chain messages require gas payment on source chain.

## 2.2 Decision Point Analysis

### Decision 1: Rebase Timing Mechanism

- [x] **Option A**: Scheduled Time-Based Rebases
  - **Pros**:
    - Predictable rebase schedule
    - Simpler user experience
    - Reduced gas costs from batched operations
  - **Cons**:
    - May not respond quickly to market changes
    - Time-based triggers require external automation
    - All chains must be available at scheduled times
  - **Performance Impact**: Reduced on-chain activity with predictable load spikes
  - **Security Implications**: Lower risk of manipulation but requires secure timekeeping
  - **Maintenance Considerations**: Requires monitoring to ensure rebases occur on schedule
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Medium complexity requiring reliable scheduler

- [ ] **Option B**: Event-Driven Rebases
  - **Pros**:
    - More responsive to market conditions
    - No reliance on external scheduling
    - Can trigger when profit reaches optimal threshold
  - **Cons**:
    - Less predictable for users
    - Might trigger too frequently, increasing gas costs
    - More complex coordination across chains
  - **Performance Impact**: Potentially higher on-chain activity with irregular patterns
  - **Security Implications**: Higher risk of manipulation through intentional triggering
  - **Maintenance Considerations**: Requires monitoring of trigger thresholds
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Higher complexity in coordination logic

**Recommendation**: Option A because it provides predictability for users, reduces the risk of rebasing during high volatility periods, and allows for more efficient gas usage through batched operations.

**Decision**: Option A selected (Scheduled Time-Based Rebases) based on user confirmation on 2025-03-26.

### Decision 2: Withdrawal Queue Processing Strategy

- [ ] **Option A**: Process Queues During Regular Operations
  - **Pros**:
    - More responsive withdrawal processing
    - Better user experience with potentially faster withdrawals
    - Distributes gas costs across normal operations
  - **Cons**:
    - More complex codebase with withdrawal logic in multiple functions
    - Potential for partial queue processing, leaving some users waiting
    - Higher risk of processing race conditions
  - **Performance Impact**: More frequent but smaller queue processing operations
  - **Security Implications**: More entry points to check for reentrancy
  - **Maintenance Considerations**: Logic spread across multiple functions
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Higher complexity due to distributed logic

- [x] **Option B**: Process Queues Only During Rebalancing
  - **Pros**:
    - Simpler, more focused withdrawal processing
    - Guaranteed complete queue processing when liquidity is available
    - Cleaner separation of concerns in codebase
  - **Cons**:
    - Users may wait longer for withdrawals
    - More gas used in single operations
    - Depends on regular rebalancing operations
  - **Performance Impact**: Less frequent but larger queue processing operations
  - **Security Implications**: Cleaner security model with fewer entry points
  - **Maintenance Considerations**: More isolated code, easier to maintain
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Lower complexity with centralized logic

**Recommendation**: Option B because it provides a cleaner code structure, reduces the risk of partial queue processing, and aligns withdrawal processing with liquidity availability from rebalancing operations.

**Decision**: Option B selected (Process Queues Only During Rebalancing) based on user confirmation on 2025-03-26.

### Decision 3: Cross-Chain Communication Protocol

- [ ] **Option A**: Pure Hyperlane Integration
  - **Pros**:
    - Simpler integration with a single messaging protocol
    - Lower complexity in cross-chain logic
    - Well-established security properties
  - **Cons**:
    - Single point of failure in cross-chain messaging
    - Limited by Hyperlane's chain support
    - Subject to Hyperlane's fee structure
  - **Performance Impact**: Dependent on Hyperlane's performance characteristics
  - **Security Implications**: Security bound by Hyperlane's security model
  - **Maintenance Considerations**: Easier to maintain with single integration
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Lower integration complexity

- [x] **Option B**: Hybrid Messaging With Fallback Systems
  - **Pros**:
    - Higher resilience through multiple messaging options
    - Can optimize for cost or speed depending on requirements
    - Not dependent on a single protocol's chain support
  - **Cons**:
    - Much higher complexity in routing and fallback logic
    - Harder to reason about security properties
    - More complex testing and validation required
  - **Performance Impact**: Potentially better performance with optimal routing
  - **Security Implications**: More complex security considerations with multiple paths
  - **Maintenance Considerations**: Higher maintenance overhead with multiple integrations
  - **Complexity Assessment**: Significantly higher integration complexity

**Recommendation**: Option A because the current implementation already uses Hyperlane effectively, the simplicity offers better security properties, and the protocol doesn't require the added complexity of hybrid messaging at this stage.

**Decision**: Option B selected (Hybrid Messaging With Fallback Systems) based on user confirmation on 2025-03-26. While this increases complexity, it provides greater resilience and flexibility for cross-chain operations.

  - Protocol operates across multiple EVM-compatible chains
  - Each chain has independent StablePool and EcoDollar contracts
  - Home chain contains master Rebaser contract
  - Hyperlane provides cross-chain messaging infrastructure

- **External Interfaces**: 
  - Hyperlane Mailbox for cross-chain messaging
  - Lit Protocol for solver authorization
  - Circle's CCTP for cross-chain token transfers
  - Intent System for cross-chain task execution

- **Internal Components**: 
  - EcoDollar: Share-based rebasing token
  - StablePool: Multi-token liquidity pool with withdrawal queue
  - Rebaser: Cross-chain rebase coordinator
  - IntentSource/Inbox: Intent-based execution system

- **Data Models**: 
  - Share-based accounting for rebasing token
  - Linked list structure for withdrawal queues
  - TokenAmount for token management
  - WithdrawalQueueEntry/Info for queue management

- **Processing Logic**: 
  - Rebase Cycle: Pools report shares & balances → Home chain calculates rate → Rate propagated to all chains
  - Deposit/Withdraw: User deposits stablecoin → Mint eUSD / User burns eUSD → Withdraw stablecoin or queue
  - Liquidity Access: Solver gets signature → Pool verifies → Allow access → Execute intent

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Custom errors for all failure cases
  - Graceful handling of cross-chain message failures
  - Withdrawal queue for liquidity shortfalls

### Algorithm and Logic Specification

#### Rebase Algorithm

```
1. FUNCTION initiateRebase(tokens)
2.   VERIFY caller is authorized
3.   VERIFY rebase not already in progress
4.   SET rebaseInProgress = true
5.   CALCULATE local tokens value
6.   CALCULATE local shares value
7.   SEND message to home chain with tokens and shares
8. END FUNCTION

9. FUNCTION handle(origin, sender, message) // On home chain
10.  VERIFY sender is valid pool contract
11.  VERIFY origin chain is whitelisted
12.  DECODE tokens and shares from message
13.  INCREMENT currentChainCount
14.  ADD tokens to sharesTotal
15.  ADD balances to balancesTotal
16.  IF currentChainCount equals total chains THEN
17.    CALCULATE net new balances
18.    CALCULATE protocol share
19.    CALCULATE new multiplier
20.    CALCULATE protocol mint rate
21.    RESET counters
22.    FOR EACH chain
23.      PROPAGATE rebase information
24.    END FOR
25.  END IF
26. END FUNCTION

27. FUNCTION handle(origin, sender, message) // On spoke chains
28.  VERIFY sender is rebaser contract
29.  VERIFY origin is home chain
30.  DECODE multiplier and protocol mint rate
31.  CALL rebase on eUSD contract
32.  MINT protocol share to pool
33.  SET rebaseInProgress = false
34. END FUNCTION
```

#### Withdrawal Queue Algorithm

```
1. FUNCTION withdraw(token, amount)
2.   VERIFY user has sufficient eUSD balance
3.   BURN user's eUSD
4.   IF token balance > threshold THEN
5.     TRANSFER token to user
6.     EMIT Withdrawn event
7.   ELSE
8.     ADD user to withdrawal queue
9.     EMIT AddedToWithdrawalQueue event
10.  END IF
11. END FUNCTION

12. FUNCTION processWithdrawalQueue(token)
13.   GET queue information
14.   GET head entry
15.   WHILE entry.next != 0 AND token balance > threshold
16.     TRANSFER token to entry.user
17.     UPDATE head pointer
18.     GET next entry
19.   END WHILE
20.   IF token balance <= threshold THEN
21.     EMIT WithdrawalQueueThresholdReached event
22.   END IF
23.   UPDATE queue head pointer
24. END FUNCTION
```

### State Management

- **State Transitions**: 
  - Deposit: User funds → Pool, eUSD minted
  - Withdraw: eUSD burned, User receives funds or enters queue
  - Rebase: Collection phase → Calculation phase → Distribution phase
  - Queue Processing: Pending → Processed as liquidity available

- **Persistent State**: 
  - EcoDollar: Total shares, user share balances
  - StablePool: Token whitelist, thresholds, queue structures
  - Rebaser: Chain list, protocol rate

- **Transient State**: 
  - Rebase in progress flag
  - Current chain count during rebase
  - Accumulated shares and balances during rebase

## 3.5 Implementation Approach

### TDD Workflow

1. **Write Failing Test**: Create test that defines expected behavior for each atomic function
2. **Implement Minimal Solution**: Write code to make test pass with minimal implementation
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining passing tests
4. **Repeat**: For each atomic function or behavior in the task

### Security-First Development

1. **Threat Model First**: Document security assumptions and threats before implementation
2. **Safe Implementation**: Use secure patterns and libraries (OpenZeppelin, SafeERC20)
3. **Verify Security Properties**: Test explicitly for security properties (access control, reentrancy)
4. **Security Review**: Dedicated security review step using Slither and manual inspection

## D. Technical Research Notes

The Crowd Liquidity Protocol builds on the Eco Routes intent-based cross-chain system by adding a dedicated liquidity layer with a rebasing stablecoin. The key innovation is the combination of:

1. **Cross-Chain Rebasing**: Allowing a token to maintain consistent value and distribute yield across multiple chains through a coordinated rebase process.

2. **Withdrawal Queue Management**: Ensuring fair processing of withdrawals even during liquidity shortfalls.

3. **Solver-Driven Liquidity Access**: Enabling intent solvers to access pool liquidity for cross-chain operations with proper authorization.

4. **Fee Structure for Sustainability**: Multiple fee types to incentivize network participants and sustain protocol operations.

This approach differs from traditional cross-chain stablecoins by using a yield-bearing model with automated rebalancing and a formalized queue structure for maintaining stability during varying liquidity conditions.
