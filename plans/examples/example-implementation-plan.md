## Analysis

<!-- Detailed analysis of the problem and proposed solution. Include relevant context, existing patterns, and any constraints -->

This plan demonstrates the format that Claude will use when planning complex tasks. Plans like this will be created in the `plans/` directory before Claude begins task execution. The user will have a chance to review and approve the plan before execution begins.

## Decision Points

<!-- Claude will include this section when there are multiple implementation options -->

### Decision 1: Implementation Approach

- [ ] Option A: Use existing library
  - Pros: Faster implementation, well-tested code
  - Cons: Additional dependency, may include unused features
- [ ] Option B: Custom implementation
  - Pros: More control, smaller footprint
  - Cons: More development time, need to write tests

Recommendation: Option A because it aligns with project's approach to leverage existing solutions when available and reduces development time.

### Decision 2: API Design

- [ ] Option A: REST API
  - Pros: Familiar pattern, easy to document
  - Cons: Less efficient for complex data
- [ ] Option B: GraphQL
  - Pros: More flexible, client can request exactly what it needs
  - Cons: Steeper learning curve, more complex setup

Recommendation: Option B because the data structure is complex and clients have varying data needs.

## Dependencies

<!-- List of dependencies that might affect execution -->

- Step 2 depends on completion of Step 1.2
- Step 3.1 depends on Decision 1 implementation choice
- Final testing depends on all implementation steps

## Pre-execution Checklist

<!-- Items to verify before beginning implementation -->

- [ ] All decision points resolved by user (exactly ONE option selected per decision)
- [ ] Verify development environment is active
- [ ] Confirm all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Check for clean git status or backup changes
- [ ] Verify access to required resources
- [ ] Confirm test framework is operational
- [ ] Verify subtasks are atomic and independently testable
- [ ] Confirm validation criteria defined for each subtask
- [ ] Verify git branch naming follows convention `task/descriptive-name`
- [ ] Ensure each subtask has clear completion criteria
- [ ] Confirm security validation checkpoints are defined
- [ ] Verify testing approach covers unit, integration, and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure commit message convention is understood and will be followed

## Files to Modify

<!-- List of files that will be modified, with brief description of changes -->

- src/ComponentA.sol: Add new functionality
- src/ComponentB.sol: Update interface
- test/ComponentA.t.sol: Add new test cases

## Implementation Details

<!-- Details about the implementation approach. Include important technical decisions, algorithms, data structures, etc. -->

### Core Architecture

The implementation will introduce the following key components:

1. **Component Interface**:

```solidity
interface IComponentA {
  function processData(
    uint256 amount,
    address target
  ) external returns (uint256);
  function calculateValue(uint256 input) external view returns (uint256);
  // Additional interface functions will be defined here
}
```

2. **Data Structures**:

```solidity
struct ProcessingParams {
  uint256 amount;
  address target;
  bool useDefaultSettings;
  uint256 minAcceptableResult;
}
```

3. **Core Functionality Implementation**:

```solidity
// Before:
function example() public {
  // Old implementation
}

// After:
function example() public {
  // New implementation with improvements
}
```

### Operation Flow

The implementation will follow these processing steps:

1. Validate input parameters against defined constraints
2. Process data through core calculation logic
3. Apply business rules and validation checks
4. Return computed results with proper error handling

### Key Improvements

- Enhanced input validation with custom error types
- Gas optimization for core calculation loops
- Improved security through strict access control
- Better testability with modular design

## Testing Strategy

<!-- Comprehensive approach to testing the changes -->

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for the entire flow
- Edge case testing for error scenarios
- Incremental testing after each logical code change
- Commands to run:

  ```bash
  # Run specific test
  forge test --match-test testExample -vv

  # Run all tests
  forge test

  # Check gas usage
  forge snapshot
  ```

## Validation Checkpoints

<!-- Detailed validation requirements for each atomic subtask -->

```

### Validation Criteria

- **Test Coverage**: 100% MANDATORY for each subtask (functions, lines, branches)
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation
- **Compilation**: No errors or warnings
- **Unit Tests**: ALL tests MUST pass with no failures
- **Security Checks**: No critical or high severity issues
- **Gas Analysis**: Gas usage within acceptable limits
- **Documentation**: Complete, accurate, and follows standards
- **Requirements**: All specified requirements fully satisfied

#### CRITICAL: 100% TEST COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS

- Every function must have dedicated test cases
- Every branch/condition must be tested
- Every error/exception path must be tested
- Every input validation rule must be tested
- Every state change must be verified
- Every security property must be validated
- Coverage must be verified with `forge coverage` before EVERY commit

Each subtask MUST satisfy ALL applicable validation criteria before being marked as complete and committed to the repository. NO EXCEPTIONS to the 100% test coverage requirement are permitted without explicit user approval.

## TODO Tracker

<!-- Claude will track all added TODOs here -->

| Location              | TODO Type | Description                 | Status       |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| src/ComponentA.sol:42 | optimize  | Improve performance of loop | Pending      |
| src/ComponentB.sol:15 | remove    | Temporary debug statement   | Must resolve |

## Known Edge Cases

<!-- Known edge cases that need to be handled -->

- Zero value inputs should be handled gracefully
- Error cases should return appropriate custom errors
- Large number operations should not overflow

## Potential Risks

<!-- Potential risks and their mitigations -->

- Risk 1: Performance impact on existing functionality
  - Mitigation: Profile before and after changes
- Risk 2: Backwards compatibility issues
  - Mitigation: Run regression tests and verify all existing functionality

## Rollback Procedure

<!-- What to do if implementation fails -->

If implementation fails at any point:

1. Document the issue in the "ERROR ENCOUNTERED" section
2. Identify root causes and develop hypotheses
3. Create a debugging plan with multiple approaches
4. If unresolvable within scope, create a "BLOCKING ISSUE" section
5. Rollback specific changes with:
   ```bash
   git restore <files>
   ```
6. Verify clean state with `git status`
7. Document reason for rollback in plan history

## Standards Compliance

<!-- Checklist for ensuring code standards compliance -->

- [ ] All public/external functions have comprehensive NatSpec comments
- [ ] Custom errors are used instead of require strings for all error conditions
- [ ] Events are emitted for all relevant state changes
- [ ] Function ordering follows project standard: external → public → internal → private
- [ ] Gas optimizations are documented and benchmarked
- [ ] Security considerations are explicitly documented
- [ ] 4-space indentation and 120 character line length limit

## Error Handling and Debugging

<!-- Claude will add this section if errors are encountered -->

### 🛑 ERROR ENCOUNTERED

**Location**: src/ComponentA.sol:42
**Current Step**: Step 3.1 - Update core module
**Error Message**:

```
Error: CompileError: Type uint256 is not implicitly convertible to expected type int256.
   --> src/ComponentA.sol:42:13:
    |
 42 |     int256 result = calculateValue(amount);
    |             ^^^^^^
```

**Suspected Root Causes**:

1. Type mismatch between calculateValue return type (uint256) and assigned variable (int256)
2. Missing type conversion in the function call

### Debugging Plan

- [ ] Hypothesis 1: Check the return type of calculateValue [Priority: High]
  - [ ] Review the function definition in src/ComponentB.sol
  - [ ] Verify if the function is expected to return uint256
- [ ] Hypothesis 2: Examine if negative values are expected [Priority: Medium]
  - [ ] Determine if result needs to be int256 or can be uint256
  - [ ] Check usage of the result variable in subsequent code

### Debugging Session Log

- 2025-03-16 11:05: Identified error during Step 3.1 implementation
- 2025-03-16 11:10: Verified calculateValue returns uint256 as expected
- 2025-03-16 11:15: Determined result should remain int256 due to later subtraction operations

### Proposed Fix

```solidity
// Before:
int256 result = calculateValue(amount);

// After:
int256 result = int256(calculateValue(amount));
```

**Explanation**: Added explicit casting from uint256 to int256 since the value from calculateValue() is known to always fit within int256 range and we need to use the value in signed integer operations later in the code.

**Potential Side Effects**: None - values are verified to be within safe range for casting.

## SCOPE BOUNDARY ISSUE: Integration with External Component

<!-- Claude will add this section if implementation requires out-of-scope changes -->

**Problem Description**:
During implementation of feature X, we discovered that changes to ComponentC would be required, which is outside the defined scope of this task. ComponentC needs to expose additional data that our implementation depends on.

**Out-of-Scope Files Affected**:

- src/ComponentC.sol: Would need to add a new getter method
- src/interfaces/IComponentC.sol: Interface would need updating with new method

**Alternative Approaches**:

- [ ] **Option 1**: Request permission to modify ComponentC

  - Files to modify: src/ComponentC.sol, src/interfaces/IComponentC.sol
  - Proposed changes: Add new getter method to expose required data
  - Pros: Cleanest integration, most maintainable solution
  - Cons: Requires modifying out-of-scope files, increases task scope

- [ ] **Option 2**: Create adapter for ComponentC

  - Approach: Implement adapter that works with current ComponentC interface
  - Pros: Stays within scope, no modification to existing files
  - Cons: Additional indirection, potentially less efficient

- [ ] **Option 3**: Recalculate needed data
  - Approach: Duplicate calculation logic to derive the needed data
  - Pros: No changes to ComponentC, fully independent
  - Cons: Duplicate logic, potential for inconsistencies if ComponentC changes

**Selected Approach**: [Will be filled after user selection]

## Final Code Review and Cleanup

## Progress

<!-- Overall progress tracking, updated by Claude as work progresses -->

- [x] Plan created
- [ ] Plan approved by user
- [ ] Decisions confirmed by user (all Decision Points have exactly ONE selected option)
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Testing complete
- [ ] Final review complete

## Implementation Strategy

### Atomic Task Implementation Approach

Each component will be implemented following this strict atomic approach:

1. **Test Definition Phase**:

   - Define test cases covering normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions
   - Establish expected behavior and results
   - Create mock inputs and expected outputs
   - Write test fixture contracts if needed

2. **Implementation Phase**:

   - Implement minimal code to pass the tests
   - Follow security best practices
   - Add appropriate error handling
   - Implement proper parameter validation

3. **Validation Phase**:

   - Run tests to verify implementation
   - Check test coverage is 100%
   - Perform gas analysis
   - Verify security properties

4. **Optimization Phase**:

   - Identify gas optimization opportunities
   - Refactor for better efficiency
   - Verify optimizations don't break functionality
   - Compare gas costs before and after

5. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Add comprehensive NatSpec comments
   - Document edge cases and limitations
   - Add usage examples
   - Document gas considerations

Each component must complete all phases before being considered done, with no exceptions to the 100% test coverage requirement.

## Mid-Execution Change Requests

<!-- Documents changes requested by the user during execution -->

### Change Request 1: Use SafeCast Library

**Timestamp**: 2025-03-16 11:20
**Current Step**: Step 3.1 (During debugging)
**Original Request**:

> Try using SafeCast instead of direct casting for better overflow protection

**Analysis**:
The user has suggested using the SafeCast library instead of direct casting. This would provide better overflow protection and follows best practices. The change would require:

1. Importing the SafeCast library
2. Modifying the proposed fix to use SafeCast.toInt256() instead of direct casting
3. No changes to the overall architecture or approach

**Plan Updates**:

- Added new sub-task 3.1.4: "Implement SafeCast for type conversions"
- Updated proposed fix code snippet
- Added SafeCast to the list of imports in affected files

### Change Request 2: Add Negative Input Validation

**Timestamp**: 2025-03-16 14:15
**Current Step**: Step 4.2 (Validation)
**Original Request**:

> Also add validation for negative inputs, they should revert with a custom error

**Analysis**:
User wants additional input validation to check for negative values. This requires:

1. Adding a new custom error definition
2. Adding a validation check at the beginning of the function
3. Adding test cases for the negative input scenario

**Plan Updates**:

- Added new sub-task 4.2.3: "Implement negative input validation"
- Added new test case to testing strategy
- Updated Files to Modify section with new validation logic

## BLOCKING ISSUE: Dependency Version Conflict

<!-- Example of a blocking issue that might occur -->

**Problem Description**:
Implementation of feature X requires using library Y version 2.0, but another component is currently using version 1.5 which is incompatible. Upgrading would potentially break existing functionality.

**Impact Assessment**:

- Affected components: ComponentA, ComponentB
- Severity: High
- Timeline impact: Estimated 4-hour delay

**Potential Solutions**:

- [ ] **Solution 1**: Upgrade library Y globally to version 2.0

  - Pros: Cleaner dependency management, all components use same version
  - Cons: Requires extensive testing of all affected components
  - Implementation time: ~3 hours

- [ ] **Solution 2**: Fork library Y and maintain custom version

  - Pros: No risk to existing functionality
  - Cons: Long-term maintenance burden, technical debt
  - Implementation time: ~2 hours

- [ ] **Solution 3**: Reimplement required functionality without library Y
  - Pros: Eliminates dependency conflict entirely
  - Cons: Duplicates existing code, higher risk of bugs
  - Implementation time: ~4 hours

**Selected Solution**: [Will be filled after user selects one]

**Implementation Plan**:
[Will be filled with specific steps to implement the selected solution]
